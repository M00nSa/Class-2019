                       <div><p>Tomo is the Japanese word for friend. We incorporated the notion of friendship into our logo by using two coffee cups to represent companionship, as cups of coffee are often shared among friends. Coffee Tomo offers high-quality products in an upscale environment. Our coffee and pretzels are not “fast food.” We personally roast our beans and prepare a custom cup of coffee for our customers. Our pretzel dough is made daily to ensure premium freshness.</div> <div> <p>Coffee Tomo is determined to satisfy a daily fix for our local coffee addicts who love gourmet hand drip coffee and espresso with great service. We also provide whole beans for coffee lovers want to enjoy fresh coffee at home. Coffee Tomo will make its best effort to create a unique place where customers can socialize with each other in a comfortable and relaxing environment while enjoying a significantly higher quality, better tasting hand drip or espresso product, and special pretzel, in Los Angeles.</p></div>
