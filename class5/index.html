                <p>There is a myth so central to Hollywood’s conception of fame as a zero-sum game, in which stardom comes only at the expense of someone else, that the movie industry likes to retell the tale every generation or so. To date, there have been three versions of A Star Is Born, beginning in 1937 with Janet Gaynor as aspiring actress Esther Blodgett and Fredric March as fading movie star Norman Maine, who helps launch Esther’s career. In 1954 the story found new life as a musical, with Judy Garland as the ingénue and James Mason as her guide.</p>

Though the wardrobe changes—and so does the hair—the story remains the same: The male lead boosts the career of his struggling romantic interest, gets eclipsed, staggers drunkenly onstage during her award speech, and drowns himself in front of her Malibu beach house—or fatally crashes his Ferrari in the desert. Her elevation is his humiliation, and the cruelty of fame is to blame. </p>
