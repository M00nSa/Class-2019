                <p>There is a myth so central to Hollywood’s conception of fame as a zero-sum game, in which stardom comes only at the expense of someone else, that the movie industry likes to retell the tale every generation or so. To date, there have been three versions of A Star Is Born, beginning in 1937 with Janet Gaynor as aspiring actress Esther Blodgett and Fredric March as fading movie star Norman Maine, who helps launch Esther’s career. In 1954 the story found new life as a musical, with Judy Garland as the ingénue and James Mason as her guide.</p>

                <p> It returned again in 1976 with Barbra Streisand as a nightclub singer and Kris Kristofferson as the arena rocker who uplifts her. Though the wardrobe changes—and so does the hair—the story remains the same: The male lead boosts the career of his struggling romantic interest, gets eclipsed, staggers drunkenly onstage during her award speech, and drowns himself in front of her Malibu beach house—or fatally crashes his Ferrari in the desert. Her elevation is his humiliation, and the cruelty of fame is to blame. </p>

            <p>This October, a new A Star Is Born will arrive, co-written and directed by Bradley Cooper, who also stars as Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking country musician who falls in love with a promising young singer played by Lady Gaga, in the pop star’s first major movie role. This telling of the fable will feature all the elements that have made its predecessors so beloved—romance, music, a peek behind the curtain, and a female character with a devastating inner conflict to play out.  </p>
