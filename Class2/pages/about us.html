        Coffee Tomo, which means friend in Japanese. Friendship at Coffee Tomo is represented in their logo by using two coffee cups hugging each other. They carefully roast their beans in the shop every day ensuring that coffee doesnâ€™t lose its quality and aroma. Tomo currently offers coffee from Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, and has a wide selection of teas and non-coffee drinks, being the sweet potato latte the most original one we've ever tried.
